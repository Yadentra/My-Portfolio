# Equivalence Partitioning
## Assignment Details
Equivalence Partitioning is a testing technique that divides input data into valid and invalid partitions. By testing a representative value from each partition, we can reduce the number of test cases without sacrificing coverage.
### Example
For a system accepting integers from 1 to 1000:
- **Valid partitions**: 
  - [1, 1000]
- **Invalid partitions**:
  - Less than 1
  - Greater than 1000
