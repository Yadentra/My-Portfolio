# Boundary Value Analysis
## Assignment Details
Boundary Value Analysis focuses on testing at the boundaries of input values. It is based on the premise that errors are more likely to occur at the edges of input ranges.
### Example
For a system accepting integers from 1 to 1000, test the following boundary values:
- **Lower Boundaries**:
  - 0 (invalid)
  - 1 (valid)
- **Upper Boundaries**:
  - 999 (valid)
  - 1000 (valid)
  - 1001 (invalid)
